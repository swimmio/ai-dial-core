# Performance Considerations

The Proxy service restricts the allowed HTTP methods to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to enhance performance by limiting the types of requests handled.

```java
    public static final int REQUEST_BODY_MAX_SIZE_BYTES = 16 * 1024 * 1024;
    public static final int FILES_REQUEST_BODY_MAX_SIZE_BYTES = 512 * 1024 * 1024;

    private static final Set<HttpMethod> ALLOWED_HTTP_METHODS = Set.of(HttpMethod.GET, HttpMethod.POST, HttpMethod.PUT, HttpMethod.DELETE);
```

# Security Considerations

Security is enforced through access control checks in the `hasAccess` method, which verifies user roles and assesses limits based on deployment configurations.

```java
    public static boolean hasAccess(ProxyContext context, Deployment deployment) {
        return hasAssessByLimits(context, deployment) && hasAccessByUserRoles(context, deployment);
    }
```
