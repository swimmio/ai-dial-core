# Overview of `moveResource` Function

The `moveResource` function orchestrates the process of moving shared access from one resource to another. It first copies the shared access and then revokes the original shared access.

```java
    public void moveSharedAccess(String bucket, String location, ResourceDescription source, ResourceDescription destination) {
        // copy shared access from source to destination
        copySharedAccess(bucket, location, source, destination);
        // revoke shared access from source
        revokeSharedAccess(bucket, location, new ResourceLinkCollection(Set.of(new ResourceLink(source.getUrl()))));
    }
```

# Step 1: Copy Shared Access

The `copySharedAccess` function is called to duplicate the shared access settings from the source to the destination resource. This is the first step in the resource moving process.

```java
        copySharedAccess(bucket, location, source, destination);
```

# Step 2: Revoke Original Shared Access

After successfully copying the shared access, `revokeSharedAccess` is invoked to remove the shared access from the original resource, ensuring that the access privileges are only valid at the new location.

```java
        revokeSharedAccess(bucket, location, new ResourceLinkCollection(Set.of(new ResourceLink(source.getUrl()))));
```
